# shortcut
Simple app to access shortcuts in a .txt file.

It reads the file named shortcut_list.txt in the source directory and generates an interface in which you can open each file or directory associated with an alias.

The file layout must be as follows:

Note: this is displayed incorrectly in the default github visualizer.

alias1,path1
alias2,path2
(...)
aliasN,pathN

for example:
my C drive,C:\
some document folder,C:\documents
some document file,C:\documents\file.txt
